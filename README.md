Item Filter App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Project Overview
The Item Filter App allows users to filter a list of items in real-time based on a search input. The app is optimized to minimize unnecessary re-renders using React best practices such as memoization and state management with Redux Toolkit.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The app will automatically reload if you make edits to the source files.
You may see lint errors in the console if any issues occur during development.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

Unit tests for components and Redux logic are included.
To learn more about testing in Create React App, check the testing documentation.
npm run build
Builds the app for production and optimizes it for performance.

The production build will be outputted to the build/ directory.
React is bundled in production mode for improved performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for better cache control.
Your app is now ready for deployment.
For more information about deployment, see Create React App’s Deployment Guide.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back!

If you require more control over your build setup (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can run npm run eject to expose configuration files and adjust them as needed.

Most users don't need to eject, and it's recommended only when necessary for advanced customization.

Features
Real-time Search Filtering: Users can filter a list of items by typing in a search field.
Efficient State Management: Managed using Redux Toolkit for scalability and ease of debugging.
Optimized Rendering: Utilizes React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and custom hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Testing: Includes unit tests for components and Redux slices using Jest and React Testing Library.
Installation Instructions
Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from nodejs.org.

Step-by-Step Installation

Step-by-Step Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/item-filter-app.git
cd item-filter-app


Install dependencies:
npm install
Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux: If not already installed, you can run:



npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

Start the development server:
npm start
Run tests (optional):

npm test
Optimization Techniques
This project is optimized to avoid unnecessary re-renders using various techniques, including:

React.memo: The Item component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent re-renders unless its props change.
useMemo: Used to memoize the filtered list of items.
useCallback: The event handler functions in the SearchBar component are wrapped with useCallback to prevent unnecessary recreations on every render.
Custom Hook: The search logic is abstracted into a custom hook (useSearch) to separate logic from UI and optimize re-renders.
Testing
The project includes unit tests for Redux slices and React components. Tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library.

To run the tests:


npm test
The test suite will automatically re-run when you make changes to your code.

Deployment
Build for Production
When you're ready to deploy your app, you can create a production build:



npm run build
This will create a build directory containing all the necessary static files to deploy your app.

Future Enhancements
Pagination: Implement pagination to further enhance performance for large item lists.
Debounced Search: Add debouncing to reduce the number of renders during fast typing.
Improved UI: Apply additional styling and animations to make the UI more visually appealing.
